# Pfsa4 paper analysis

This folder contains scripts to conduct the analyses described in:

Hamilton W. et al, "*A fourth locus in the Plasmodium falciparum genome associated with sickle haemoglobin*", bioRxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.14.557461

## Running the scripts

The two main scripts are expressed as R markdown files as follows:

* `association.Rmd` which prepares data, computes principal components, and conductes genome-wide association tests between P.falciparum genetic variants and the host genotypes HbS and HbC

* `meta_analysis.Rmd` which meta-analyses the main signal across datasets.
